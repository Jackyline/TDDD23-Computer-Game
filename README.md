# TDDD23-Computer-Game
This is a game created by Hannes JÃ¤mtner and Dawid Abucewicz for the course TDDD23.

## :goal_net: Goal of the course
The goal of this course was to create a game from scratch where you design and program your own game.

## :space_invader: About the game
The game is developed in the game engine Godot. This was a new experience for both of us and a challenging one.
We wanted to make a completely new game, a game that we had not seen before. We found a problem in textbook about optimizing, we then knew a genre would be puzzle.
The game we created was called **Plumber for engineers**, which is a plumber game. The game is about to reach all the pipes on shortest amount of moves and finish all the levels. 
The game is aimed towards those around the age of 12.
